# Python Plotting: Matplotlib

Materials for teaching the Matplotlib workshop at UC Berkeley's D-Lab.

## Outline

For this workshop, we'll cover plotting with Matplotlib. We'll use both the scripted and object-oriented interfaces, working through examples in a Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebook. The following plot types will be covered:

* line
* bar
* scatter
* boxplot

We'll also learn about:

* creating multiple plots in a single figure
* styles and customizing plots

Throughout the workshop, we'll discuss the plot types best suited for particular kinds of data.

Basic familiarity with Python *is* assumed.

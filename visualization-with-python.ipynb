    "Visualization is meant to convey information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The power of a graph is its ability to enable one to take in the quantitative information, organize it, and see patterns and structure not readily revealed by other means of studying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Cleveland and McGill, 1984\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain techniques make that information easier to interpret and understand. In their 1984 paper titled, \"[Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cpsc533c-04-spr/readings/cleveland.pdf),\" Cleveland and McGill identify 10 elementary perceptual tasks that are used to \"extract quantitative information from graphs.\" Their premise is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A graphical form that involves elementary perceptual tasks that lead to more accurate judgments than another graphical form (with the same quantitative information) will result in better organization and increase the chances of a correct perception of patterns and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas graph design had, up to that point, been \"largely unscientific,\" Cleveland and McGill took a systematic approach in analyzing human graphical perception through experimentation. Their researched helped identify the most and least accurate elementary percentual tasks, ordered below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position along a common scale\n",
    "2. Position along non-aligned scales\n",
    "3. Length, direction, angle\n",
    "4. Area\n",
    "5. Volume, curvature\n",
    "6. Shading, color saturation\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010, [Heer and Bostock](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-MTurk-CHI.pdf) confirmed these results using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.\n",

For example, \"A\" is smaller than \"B.\" However, for circles, such as \"L\" and \"M,\" that are almost the same size, it's difficult to tell which is smaller. Area, according to Cleveland and McGill's research, is less accurate than, say, length, which we consider next."

    "Next, we consider a case where we want to plot two series. For this example, let's suppose we're working with student English and math test scores. Here, we'll want to use bars, which we arbitrarily label Z-L. The question is, which bars should we use? This is a case where the answer depends on what we're trying to communicate.

    "\n",
    "These findings are a *guide* for what works when the goal is to make accurate judgments. Sometimes, however, the goal might not be to allow for precise comparisons but, rather, to facilitate the perception of larger patterns. This is usually the case with choropleth maps."
